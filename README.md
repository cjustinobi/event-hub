## Event Hub

## Description

Event helps to create a win-win business scenerio for both the event organizers and pontential attendees.

This is achieved by ensuring attendees pay for a refundable event fee to a pool. 10 percent of the total event fee of those that could not attend after RSVPing goes the event organizer and the 90 percent is shared amongst those that actually attended.

One can see past events he/she attended, upcoming events, and ongoing events.

## The Problem Event Hub solves

It is demoralizing the have empty events after so much work has gone into it. With the business model, it would be enticing
for pontentail attendees to actually attend events they RSVPed seeing:
- They are going to be refunded after attending
- There is likelyhood of participating from a pool of absentees

This measures would ensure events receive a good turn up.
